# Pyela
_Tools and application programming interfaces (APIs) for the open-source & free MMORPG, Eternal Lands._

Pyela is an implementation of the Eternal Lands network protocol in Python. The aim of this project is to provide an object oriented API and framework for communicating over the Eternal Lands protocol and to allow rapid and simple development of tools and other features that would communicate with an EL server (such as bots).

Apart from the APIs, there are also tools in the works. The first of which is a GTK Python chat application. It's currently in the early development stage but is already functional and usable. You can download that [http://pyela.googlecode.com/files/pyela-gui-0.4.tar  here].

## Requirements
You will need the following software packages/libraries installed on your computer before using any of the Pyela framework:

* Python 3.2 or later
* GTK+ 3.0

GTK is only needed for the GUI based applications.

## Documentation
Learn how to use pyela-net, the first pyela module, to connect to an Eternal Lands server in Python: [UsingPyelaNet](https://github.com/atc-/pyela/wiki/Using-Pyela-Net).

Understand the possibilities of Pyela as a bot framework with [PyelaBotFramework](https://github.com/atc-/pyela/wiki/Pyela-as-a-bot-framework).

## About
Pyela was designed and written by [Alex Collins](http://alexcollins.org/) as a pet-project to practice python and learn network programming.
